# green-protocol
A Proof of Concept for Ben Hunt's Green Protocol

## Proposal
"The Green Protocol is a set of rules for the tokenization of symbolic betting markets in positive social good."

## High Level Components

* Decentralized, auditable database of physical objects which abstract into "tokens-of-good" NFT's (like trees under the "One Billion Trees" project-of-good proposal).
* Widely available phone (or other hardware) app for photographing, categorizing, timestamping, geostamping and uploading tree data to the Green Protocol ledger.
